    <h2>Algorithm List</h2>
    <div>
        <h3>(1) Fizz Buzz</h3>
        <p>This algorithm is a test of your use of conditional statement in combination with loops</p>

        <strong>Example</strong>
        <p>Write a function that takes a num as a value, the function logs out every number from one(1) to num. if the
            number to be logged is divisible by 3 log fizz instead, buzz if divisible by 5 and fizzBuzz if divisible by
            both 3 and 5</p>

        <h3>(2) Hameless Ransom Note</h3>
        <p>This algorithm is a test of your understanding of conditional statement, loops, runtime optimization/ time
            complexity <a href="./docs/A Simplified Explanation of the Big O Notation - Karuna Sehgal - Medium.pdf">(Big
                O notation)</a>
        </p>

        <strong>Example</strong>
        <p>write a function that takes two parameters. The first parameter is a note we want to write out from a
            magazine text as a string, the second parameter is the magazine text as a string. The purpose is to know if
            there are enough words in the magazine text to form the note. If there are enough words, return true else
            false</p>
